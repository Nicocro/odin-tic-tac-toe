Define gameBoard Object (board = 2d 3x3 array) - this will track the state of the board
define player object (name, symbol of choice)

define gameLogic Object [this is the most important bit]
- there should be a variable that keeps track of whose turn it is, at every turn it is updated. 
- makeMove method, takes as arguments (gameboard object, playerturn, playerChoice)
        - gets the playerturn 
        - checks if the playerChoice is valid move (valid if cell == Null), raise error otherwise 
        - if valid, updates state of the gameBoard object based on the playerTurn 
        - check states against set of winning states, if win --> throw win message, else
        - update player turn state 


- check win state function
